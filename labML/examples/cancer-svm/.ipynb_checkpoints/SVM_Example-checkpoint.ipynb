Finding large amounts of data that is representative of your population is a difficult task. Luckily, sklearn has a bunch of datasets that are practical for our academic needs so we can use their data.

If we validated with data the machine learning model with data it trained with, then it would not be impressive if it did well because it already saw the answer. Thus it is important to have a set of data points, separate from the training data, that will be used for the validation process.\n",
